Bruin 2 Checklist:
- GUI 
	1. needs to receive current state, GPS location, and target - done
	2. needs to send messages of the station to state machine - done
	3. needs to implement moving Bruin2 icon (readability) *not critical* - partially done, but can't complete GPS
- CSV files
	1. give local coordinates instead of pixels in waypoint map stations file (we edit this) *not crucial but helpful*
- State Machine
	1. Code for waypoint map crashes program (csv file parser header file causes problems. Possibly write our own?)
	2. Compass causing issues (code issue or physical issue?)
	3. Be able to stop if something gets in the way, we reach the waypoint etc -> goes along with LIDAR
	4. Path finding code (fuzzy logic)
- LIDAR node	
	1. Find appropriate LIDAR library on github (find on the website)
	2. Implement this code for the stopping logic (goes along with the stopping logic above)
notes:
clean up your dang folders

where should this go?

tasks accomplished:
1. installed sublime text
2. fixed shell script problems
3. configured GUI folder to output messages
4. reconfigured GUI
5. finished station talker 
6. started work on listener
7. wrote test to move the GUI icon
8. completed the xml/cmake prep for state_machine messages
9. completed listeners in the state machine from the GUI
10. edited GUI some more to account for all of the things we need 



TODO: 
1. finish the GUI's functionality
    * button needs to disable after being pressed once
    * global variable that the GUI sends out indicating if the robot should go or not?
    * get the rest of the data from the gps/hard coded in
2. implement the GUI's message functionality in main.cpp
    *go to the correct waypoint based on whichever one we want
3. fix CSV file
    * this goes along with the GUI. look at way_pointmath.h to figure this out
4. LIDAR installation
    * friday? see how far we can get
5. (If time - fix bugs in step 3 above ^^^) probably won't get here
